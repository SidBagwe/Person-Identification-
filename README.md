# About the Project

The advancement in camera technology, high speed

connectivity, and availability of huge information over media re-
sulted into developing better algorithms for person identification.

However, the recognition of a person in low resolution cameras
like CCTV is still challenging problem. Person identification
has numerous applications viz. surveillance in crowded area,
identifying and locating criminals, authentication of evidences in
CCTV footage, time attendance in premises, etc. This project
work aims at identifying a person in low resolution image
captured by webcam or in various frames of CCTV footage
by using deep learning convolution neural network (CNN). The
proposed system uses facial image of a person for this task. The
designed CNN pipeline has six convolution layers, one flattened
layer and two fully connected layers. Total 6667 images of 62
subjects are used for training of CNN framework for 500 epochs.
The designed CNN attained 98.13 percent of training accuracy.
The network will be tested for 1599 test images for recognition
accuracy and will be used to measure sensitivity and specificity
of the deep learning algorithm.
